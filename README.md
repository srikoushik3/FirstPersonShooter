# First Person Shooter
Game made using C# (Unity 3D)

Initially, the game begins with cubes of different colors. Level 1 lasts for 15 seconds, and player advances to the next level 
if the score is above 40 points.
The player wins 5 points by shooting either green cubes or white cubes. Shooting white cubes also increases the game time by 2 seconds.
However, shooting the yellow cubes decreases the game time by 3 seconds, and provides the player with no points.
